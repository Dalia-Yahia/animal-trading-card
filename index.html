				<p>The giant panda is a bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.They are omnivorous, they eat both bamboo as well as small animals and fishes.A giant panda cub weighs around 150 grams only while a fully grown male can weigh up to 150kg.They are the most expensive animals to be kept in zoos or captivity since panda costs 5 times more than the next most expensive animal, an elephant.A giant panda eats as much as 10kg of bamboo per day.Usually,pandas spend half of their day eating, and the other half sleeping
